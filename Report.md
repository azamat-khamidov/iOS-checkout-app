# Application Description:
For Assignment 2, I decided to build a simple checkout price calculator as an iOS application written in Swift. I tried to mimic the online Apple Storeâ€™s AirPods section, allowing the user to look at four different AirPods products and add the preferred ones to the bag. The application consists of multiple functionalities: adding the item to the bag (and the bag icon on the top right reflects the number of items in the bag), switching to the bag view by clicking on the bag icon, removing the items from the bag, calculating the subtotal (before tax) of all the items in the bag, the corresponding tax, and finally the total (pre-tax cost + tax). 

# Tech Stack Options Considered:
The following three tech stacks were considered before deciding on one:
* Frontend: React (web), React Native (mobile), Swift (mobile)
* Backend: Node.js, Python, Swift
