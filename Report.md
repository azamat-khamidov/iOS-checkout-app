# Application Description:
For Assignment 2, I decided to build a simple checkout price calculator as an iOS application written in Swift. I tried to mimic the online Apple Store’s AirPods section, allowing the user to look at four different AirPods products and add the preferred ones to the bag. The application consists of multiple functionalities: adding the item to the bag (and the bag icon on the top right reflects the number of items in the bag), switching to the bag view by clicking on the bag icon, removing the items from the bag, calculating the subtotal (before tax) of all the items in the bag, the corresponding tax, and finally the total (pre-tax cost + tax). 

# Tech Stack Options Considered:
The following three tech stacks were considered before deciding on one:
* Frontend: React (web), React Native (mobile), Swift (mobile)
* Backend: Node.js, Python, Swift

## Frontend:
While choosing a frontend stack for the assignment, I was deciding between a web and mobile application. For the web application, the option was to go with React; whereas for the mobile application, the two options were React Native and Swift. Given my prior experience with React and Javascript in general, React (for web) and React Native (for mobile) were the easier options for the frontend development. They are also more popular and widely used in the industry, offering more resources and support online for developers, as well as being backed by Meta and a large community of open-source developers. For these reasons, React was the best choice for a web application. However, when it comes to mobile application, both React Native and Swift have their pros and cons. React Native being React JS-based framework as well as supporting cross-platform development makes it very appealing; however, the support for cross-platform development comes at the cost of its performance and speed, which lacks when compared to applications developed using native languages such as Swift. On the other hand, my lack of experience with Swift and Xcode promises a steep learning curve. Another thing to consider for the mobile development options is the domain: both the frontend and backend of the mobile app can be developed in Swift; whereas React Native would have to be combined with another backend framework.
Decision: Considering all the pros and cons, I have decided to go with a mobile application developed in Swift for the following reason. Firstly, I chose to develop a mobile application because more and more consumers are preferring to purchase goods on their phones than on a desktop. For this reason, given that the assignment is to develop a checkout calculator, I thought it would be more appropriate to develop a mobile application. Secondly, I chose Swift as the programming language over React Native for numerous reasons. As outlined above, Swift has a better performance compared to cross-platform React Native framework. Although React Native would be an easier option for development due to my experience, my CSC301 group project as well as my club (UofT Blueprint) project involves mobile development on Swift. Therefore, familiarzing myself with the language through an assignment would make the development of larger-scale projects easier.


## Backend:
After deciding on a frontend stack, I had to choose how I would be developing the backend of the application, with the three options being Node.js, Python, and Swift. I have had the most experience with Python and then some experience with Javascript, so the first two options were the most optimal in terms of the ease of development. Between the two, Node.js’s event-driven environment (which enables asynchronous input/output and several requests to be processed at the same time) and it being interpreted with the V8 engine make it a better option when it comes to speed and performance of a web application, compared to Python (which is single-flow with slow request processing). When it comes to the learning curve, although I have experience with the Javascript programming language, I have never used Node.js for the backend; whereas I have had a good deal of experience using Python as a backend, meaning the better and faster performance of Node.js would come at the cost of a steeper learning curve. Another option is developing the entire mobile application (both front and backend) in Swift. Although the learning curve would be the steepest with Swift, Swift’s performance and speed would be better compared to Node.js and Python. Additionally, communication between the UI (frontend) and the logic (backend) of the application would be much simpler to setup as they can pass the data between each other directly, whereas with Python/Node.js, the communication would have to happen through HTTP requests and Swift on the frontend would have to parse the JSON file to access data.
Decision: Considering all the aforementioned pros and cons, as well as the fact that I have decided to build a mobile application with a Swift UI, it made the most sense to continue using Swift for the logic side of the application as well, especially given that the backend of the assignment is not heavy, so it’s not worthwhile establishing communication between a Swift frontend and some other backend technology. Although I mentioned that the learning curve would be steepest with Swift, I would have to learn it anyways for the UI, so continuing with Swift for the entirety of the application would be relatively easier.
